    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        With the rapid advancement and integration of cutting-edge technologies 
        like IoT, edge computing, blockchain, and generative AI, massive amounts 
        of real-time social and physical data are being generated for 
        transportation systems. Transportation 5.0, the next evolution in 
        intelligent mobility, is built on Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS), 
        enabling deeper human-machine collaboration. As one of the most complex 
        engineered systems, transportation faces multifaceted challenges that 
        demand cost-effective, time-sensitive, and spatially optimized 
        solutions. This workshop aims to inspire innovative approaches to these 
        challenges by leveraging CPSS-based Intelligent Transportation Systems 
        (ITS), which harness real-time social and physical data for smarter 
        decision-making. The focus is on applying CPSS-empowered ITS to enhance 
        traffic planning, dynamic routing, adaptive management, predictive 
        control, and data-driven transportation analytics--delivering greater 
        efficiency, precision, agility, and scalability. We invite researchers 
        and industry leaders to explore this transformative frontier in ITS and 
        shape the future of mobility.
